# Poracle for Individuals
Aside from using the bot in groups, it is possible to receive personalized notifications from the bot in a private chat. Since not every user is supposed to be able to message the bot directly, you have to be granted access first. To do so, you have to send the command

**`/poracle`** 

into a group chat with the bot. The respective user will be entered into the database and granted access to the private chat. You have to decide which group you want to use for access grants and inform us about your decision in advance. If you remove a user from the group for registration (which means they are no longer in a group with the bot), they lose their private access to the bot soon after.

Once you have entered the */poracle*-command, you will receive a green check mark emoji in response. Afterwards, the user has to start the bot privately. All commands in the following chapters cannot be used in the public group.
