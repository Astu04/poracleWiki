# Staticmaps
{% raw %}
Poracle supports five different staticmaps services for displaying little maps below your alarms by using `{{{staticmap}}}`. If you are using Telegram, you can set `webpage_preview` to True and put `[\u200A]({{{staticmap}}})` infront of your text to have an embedded staticmap.
{% endraw %}

## Poracle

That's the public hosted tileservercache server. Completely free and without ratelimits. **Currently not available**

## TileServerCache

That's the option for a self hosted TileServerCache server. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/123FLO321/SwiftTileserverCache). 

You need to copy the four templates located in `tileservercache_templates/` into the `Templates/` directory of your Tileserver.
